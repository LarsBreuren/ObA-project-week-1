## De sterrenkast
De sterrenkast is an interactive bookcase which aims to help young students find inspiration for their school assignment through an enjoyable medium. The user is greeted with a search query field, where they can search for books that might interest them. Once these books have loaded in, the user can view a informative page which contains more about the book. The users also have an option to transform their bookcase into a shooting gallery. Shooting away all the books that don't interest them. This way the user can search and find interesting material in an interactive and fun way.
