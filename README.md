## De sterrenkast
De sterrenkast is an interactive bookcase which aims to help young students find inspiration for their school assignment through an enjoyable medium. The user is greeted with a search query field, where they can search for books that might interest them. Once these books have loaded in, the user can view a informative page which contains more about the book. The users also have an option to transform their bookcase into a shooting gallery. Shooting away all the books that don't interest them. This way the user can search and find interesting material in an interactive and fun way.

# Opdracht 1.2 Browser technologies
Geteste features per device:
- Zoeken op 2 titels
- Verwijderen boeken
- Details boeken bekijken


## Nexus 5 - android 6.0.1 chrome 75
All functions work fine, layout is still okay. But the performance is poor because of the background JS.

## Lenovo legion y540 - Firefox 73
All functions are fine, no lagg or crashes. Layout is good and performance is good.

## Ipod touch - IOS 6.1.6 Safari 8536.25 
Website crashes about 10 seconds after loading finished, no interaction possible.

## Ipad mini - IOS 9.3.5 Safari 9.0
Fetch does not work, so interaction is not possible. Layout does load and so does the background that is rendered with JS.

## Screenreader
The website is not optimized for a screen reader because it can't read the book titles. Inside the a tag there is a h2 tag that contains the title. An easy fix would be to insert the title into the a directly. Adding an alt text to the book cover images would help as well.

# Opdracht 2
